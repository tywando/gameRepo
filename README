My game is a musical and color-based memory game. The LEDs light up a randomly chosen color and play a randomly chosen tone. Then, it turns off and does the same thing again. It will continue to do this, and the goal is to rack up as many points as you can without messing up! If the color is the same, you press the left button. If the tone is the same, you press the right button.
	
The color will flash and the tone will play for a short amount of time, so it is up to the player to pay close attention. If the player makes an incorrect input, that means the game is over. The game pauses until the player presses both buttons to start a new game.

The game has two different modes depending on the state of the switch, normal and hard. In normal, you can see the lights and hear tones for 500 milliseconds, and you have 2 seconds to provide an input. However, in hard mode you only only see and hear for 100 milliseconds, and you will have 1250 milliseconds to provide an input. 

The amount of points you gain is continually tracked and displayed on the serial monitor. If you lose, it will display “Game Over” on the serial monitor. Try to get the highest score you can in both hard and easy!

The code uses interrupt functions for both buttons and the switch. It checks to see inputs through if statements that check the values and truth value of the ISR flags.
