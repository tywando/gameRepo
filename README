My game is a musical and color-based memory game. The LEDs light up a specific color and play a specific tone. Then, it turns off and does the same thing again. If the color is different, you press the left button. If the tone is different, you will press the right button. If both are different, then you need to press both buttons. The goal of the game is to go as long as you can without messing up!
	
To start the game, you must fully cover the CPX light sensor. The color will flash and the tone will play for a short amount of time, so it is up to the player to pay close attention. If the player misses an input, that means the game is over. The game pauses until the player covers the light sensor to begin again.

The videogame will have two different modes depending on the state of the switch, normal and hard. In normal, you will be able to see the lights and hear tones for 500 milliseconds, and you will have 5 seconds to provide an input. However, in hard mode you will only see and hear for 100 milliseconds, and you will have 3 seconds to provide an input. 

The amount of time you have to provide input will be displayed on the serial monitor. The amount of rounds you win will be displayed on the serial monitor after the game has completed. If you lose, it will display “Game Over” on the serial monitor.
